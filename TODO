 - fix negative word-spacing for IE
 - change poppler and fontforge to git submodules and change linking to static to avoid segfaults in future (we have to revert some commits in popper and we are using unstabeAPI!)
 - inline SVG in page if used svg as background and dumping external images 
 - find and implement hiding invisible elemets (we render some pdf element which is somehow hidden)
 - implement dumping out more image formats.
 - implement option to use external tool to change colorspage of some images to RGB
 - solve PDF embeded in PDF 
 - allow embeded images to be dumped in full quality instead or resizing them

== Future: ==

Too difficult/complicated to implement:
 - reflowable text/combine lines/unwrapping
 - multi-thread

Not enough motivation/Lazy
 - commandline argument auto-completion
 - use absolute positioning for long whitespace
 - detect duplicate base fonts when embedding
 - disable selection if we know unicode is wrong
 - check if we can add information to the font, and let browsers show ligatures automatically
 - draw non-orthogonal lines with CSS
 - precise link destination: zoom
 - multiple charcode mapped to a same glyph
 - minimum line width of css drawing
 - separate classes for annotations (such that we don't have to hide all css drawings for printing)
 - Widget Annotation
 - handle large negative letter space
 - optimization levels
